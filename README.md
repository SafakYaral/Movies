This project is a SwiftUI-based iOS application demonstrating a clean and scalable Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture. It utilizes SQLite as the local database (managed via DB Browser for SQLite)

🚀 Features
	•	✅ MVVM Architecture
Clean separation of concerns between UI, business logic, and data layers for better scalability and testability.

 •	🗃️ SQLite Database
Local data persistence handled using SQLite, enabling lightweight and efficient data storage. Managed with DB Browser for SQLite for easy schema management and inspection.

 •	🔄 Reactive UI
SwiftUI views automatically update in response to data changes using:
	•	@State for local view state
	•	@Published and @Observable for reactive view models
	•	@ObservedObject to bind view models to the UI
	•	🧪 Highly Maintainable Codebase
Code is structured with modularity and clarity in mind, ideal for both learning and building production-ready apps.

🧰 Technologies Used
	•	Swift / SwiftUI
	•	MVVM Design Pattern
	•	SQLite (via DB Browser)
	•	Combine Framework for reactive bindings
